Hey hey, welcome to the Lido GitHub 🔨

The Lido GitHub is a place where Lido contributors come together to grow a wider staking ecosystem 🌍 We are a community of contributors strongly aligned with open-source culture and we welcome any new contributions, feature requests, issues or pull requests 💡

We are excited and honoured to be a part of the web3 developer community - we’ll see you around!

## 🏖️ About Lido

Lido is a liquid-staking protocol built to make staking as secure and decentralized as possible. As a family of open-source, peer-to-system software tools, Lido is currently deployed and functioning on the Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon blockchain networks.

The Lido protocol is governed by the Lido DAO - an independent collection of contributors, staking enthusiasts and governance participants 🏝️
